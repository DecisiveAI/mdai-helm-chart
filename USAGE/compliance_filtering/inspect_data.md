## Inspecting your data pipelines

We are using Prometheus to aggregate metrics that provide summaries of your data based on the data type and service identifiers.

### Port-forward Prometheus service

We will use the Prometheus expression browser to run queries. 

> Note: The pod name `prometheus-mdai-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0` should work however, to ensure a valid pod name, you should be able to use autocomplete to find the Prometheus pod.

```sh
kubectl -n mdai port-forward prometheus-mdai-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0 9090:9090
```

You can now navigate to [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090). 

You should see the Expression Browser ready for use, as shown below.

### Start querying

>Note: you must have your prometheus pod port-forwarded to port 9090 for the following links to work. 

#### Queries 

Report metrics from all services.

```promql
increase(
  sum by (service_name) (
    mdai_log_bytes_sent_total
  )[6m:]
)
```

Report metrics from non-noisy services

```promql
increase(
  sum by (service_name) (
    mdai_log_bytes_sent_total{service_name!~"service1234|service4321"}
  )[6m:]
)
```


Report metrics from only noisy (`service1234`) and extra noisy (`service4321`) services.

```promql
increase(
  sum by (service_name) (
    mdai_log_bytes_sent_total{service_name=~"service1234|service4321"}
  )[6m:]
)
```

#### Quick Links

These are preloaded links with panels populated from the above queries

##### Link 1 - [All queries](http://localhost:9090/graph?g0.expr=increase(%0A%20%20sum%20by%20(service_name)%20(%0A%20%20%20%20mdai_log_bytes_sent_total%0A%20%20)%5B6m%3A%5D%0A)&g0.tab=0&g0.display_mode=lines&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=15m&g1.expr=increase(%0A%20%20sum%20by%20(service_name)%20(%0A%20%20%20%20mdai_log_bytes_sent_total%7Bservice_name!~%22service1234%7Cservice4321%22%7D%0A%20%20)%5B6m%3A%5D%0A)&g1.tab=0&g1.display_mode=lines&g1.show_exemplars=0&g1.range_input=15m&g2.expr=increase(%0A%20%20sum%20by%20(service_name)%20(%0A%20%20%20%20mdai_log_bytes_sent_total%7Bservice_name%3D~%22service1234%7Cservice4321%22%7D%0A%20%20)%5B6m%3A%5D%0A)&g2.tab=0&g2.display_mode=lines&g2.show_exemplars=0&g2.range_input=15m)

This link has the following panels
* Panel 1 - Metrics for all services together
* Panel 2 - Metrics for all non-noisy services
* Panel 3 - Metrics for noisy service (`service1234`) and extra noisy service (`service4321`)

### Data is now flowing end-to-end

You can now see data flowing through your telemtery pipelines. 

*...but wait... is there too much!?*

We've planted a minor issue in the generators where they are emitting more data than you would potentially want. Let's reduce their data flow!
