# Start forwarding logs

We will now use fluentD to send all logs from the mock data generators to the OTel collector. This will connect all the steps together at you'll finally be able to see telemetry flowing through your telemetry pipelines.

## Install and use fluentd

```bash
helm upgrade --install --repo https://fluent.github.io/helm-charts fluent fluentd -f values_fluentd.yaml
```

## Validate fluentD operations

You can review the logs for the fluentD pod to ensure operations are working as expected.

Your logs should now be forwarded to the collector you set up in a previous step.
