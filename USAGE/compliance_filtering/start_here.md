# Use Case: Compliance and Dynamic Filtering

## The tech stack

This sets up a cluster with the following technologies:

- MDAI infra
- Fluentd
- MinIO

## What does this use case provide?

An end-to-end mocked example for collecting log data from services/infrastructure, stream processing and forwarding of that log data to either a compliance store or an `otlp-http` endpoint.

### Telemetry Pipelines

Two log pipelines will be create for the transmission from fluentD to MinIO via OTel data collection.

1. Compliance pipeline (see section)
2. Dynamic Filtering (see below)

### Log data generation and forwarding

- Spins up small batches of log generators that will appear to send logs for 1001 services
  - Service with `service.name` attribute of `service9999` will be really noisy
  - More can be spun up using the `example_log_generator` manifests

### Compliance

- All data collected will be filtered down to ERROR/WARNING logs and stored in MinIO.
  - MinIO can be accessed for verification of logs at rest

### Dynamic Filtering

- Filters any service's `INFO` logs that sends more than 5MB in the last 6 minutes

## Setup

### Install dependencies

#### Must have

- docker
- kind
- Helm
- k8s

#### Optional

- k9s

### Create a new cluster via kind

_Note: you will need kind and docker installed to run the following step_

```bash
kind create cluster --name mdai
```

## Install min.io

```bash
helm upgrade --install --repo https://charts.min.io minio minio -f values_minio.yaml
```

### Install MDAI without cert-manager

<i>If you have already done this from our <a href="../../README.md#without-cert-manager" target="_blank">Installation steps</a> feel free to skip to the next step.</i>

```sh
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace mdai --cleanup-on-fail --dependency-update --wait-for-jobs -f values.yaml -f values_prometheus.yaml -f values_grafana.yaml mdai .
```

### Validate

You can verify that your pods are all up and running with the following command

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

The output should look something like...

![get pods](../../media/get_pods.png)

## Congrats

You've now installed the `mdai` infrastructure and are ready to generate data to send to your new telemetry pipelines.
